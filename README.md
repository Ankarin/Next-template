This is my Next.js template. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Overview
Minimal setup for small apps. Comes with ready auth: sign up, sign in, forgot password, reset password.

Next.js 14 with server actions, Tailwind, Shadcn/ui, Tanstack(React Query), Zustand. 
Supabase - Mandatory for auth, but the connection to db is via drizzle, so switch to Planetscale or other if needed.


To run:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
